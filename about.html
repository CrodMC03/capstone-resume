        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Management Analyst for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (M&RA),
            Manpower, Analytics, & HR Systems (MAHRS) Directorate, assigned to the Total Force and HR Business Intelligence Division,
            Data Science Branch. Our mission is to develop, deliver, and sustain Human Capital business intelligence solutions to
            enhance data-driven decision-making across the Department of the Navy (DON) and the Marine Corps.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my role, I support data science initiatives by leading projects that leverage predictive analytics,
            machine learning, and advanced data visualization tools to optimize workforce planning and strategic 
            decision-making. I specialize in data manipulation, modeling, and process automation, utilizing 
            Python, R, SQL, and PySpark within a Databricks environment to improve the efficiency and accuracy of 
            manpower analytics.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Eastern University, aligning my education 
            with my professional goal of transitioning into a Data Scientist role. My studies and hands-on experience 
            in data wrangling, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis have already contributed to enhancing our 
            team’s capabilities and achieving key organizational objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, I am expanding my skill set by attending a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, 
            gaining expertise in front-end and back-end development. This complements my data science background 
            by enabling me to build interactive, data-driven applications and further streamline analytics solutions 
            for the workforce.
